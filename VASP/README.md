# VASP

This is our implementation of "[Deep Variational Autoencoder with Shallow Parallel Path for Top-N Recommendation (VASP)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05774.pdf)". 

1. run `MovieLens - preprocessing.ipynb` to download and preprocess the MovieLens20M dataset
2. then run `VASP.ipynb` to reproduce the results from the paper.
